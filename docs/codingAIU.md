## Resources for compiler and AI framework developers

Most users of the IBM z16 Integrated Accelerator for AI will be accessing it through frameworks and technologies like the IBM Deep Learning Compiler, TensorFlow, or Snap ML. 

For those that wish to develop or enhance AI frameworks and compilers to leverage the Integrated Accelerator for AI, an lower level SDK is needed.

To facilitate this, IBM has created the zDNN library. IBM zDNN is the IBM Z Deep Neural Network library, which features C apis that can simplify use of the z16 accelerator.

Details and examples can be found in the [IBM zDNN github](https://github.com/IBM/zDNN).

Note that zDNN library is packaged in z/OS 2.4 and above, and on RHEL, Ubuntu, SUSE at various levels.
