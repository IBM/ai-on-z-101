## IBM Z Accelerated for PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning framework that provides a flexible platform for building deep learning models. Released by Facebook's AI Research lab in 2016, PyTorch allows developers to create and modify models easily through its dynamic structure, which offers immediate feedback. This adaptability makes it particularly appealing for researchers and developers who want to experiment with new ideas.

PyTorch can be used on IBM zSystems and LinuxONE on Linux environments - including z/OS Container Extensions.

IBM Z Accelerated for PyTorch can be leveraged for various use cases, including applications such as language processing and computer vision. It is optimized to exploit the acceleration of IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI on IBM z16 and LinuxONE 4, which improves inference performance for a wide range of PyTorch models. 

### Getting started with the AI Toolkit for IBM Z and LinuxONE ###

The AI Toolkit for IBM Z and IBM® LinuxONE is designed to enable our clients to deploy and accelerate the adoption of popular open source AI frameworks on their z/OS® and IBM® LinuxONE platforms. The AI Toolkit follows a rigorous IBM Secure Engineering process that vets and scans open source AI-serving frameworks and IBM-certified containers for security vulnerabilities and validates compliance with industry regulations. Clients can also purchase IBM Elite Support for AI Toolkit for IBM Z and LinuxONE.

The AI Toolkit components are availble in the IBM Z and LinuxONE Container Image Registry (ICR). This registry includes open-source software in container images that are often used as the foundation for new composite workloads. It provides a secure and trustworthy content source. On the IBM Z and LinuxONE Container Registry, these components of AI Toolkit for IBM Z and LinuxONE are freely available.
