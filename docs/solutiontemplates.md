[AI Solution Templates on IBM Z & LinuxONE](https://ibm.biz/aionz-solution-templates) are available within [The Open Mainframe Project](https://openmainframeproject.org/)!

## What are they? ##
AI Solution Templates are a suite of pre-built blueprints that guide you through the full AI lifecycle on IBM Z with various enterprise use cases while leveraging a variety of technologies. Whether you’re a senior data scientist or have no previous AI skills, build your own AI model, deploy it on IBM Z, and integrate it into a business application.

You can now experience the following AI Solution Templates:

- [Fraud Detection using MLz](https://ibm.biz/aionz-st-fd)
- [Credit Risk Assessment using MLz](https://ibm.biz/aionz-st-cra)
- [Health Insurance Claims using MLz](https://ibm.biz/aionz-st-hic)
- [Fraud Detection using AI Toolkit](https://ibm.biz/aionz-st-fd-tis)


## Why should I use them? ##
AI Solution Templates accelerate your time to value by jumpstarting your AI deployment on IBM Z through rapid prototyping. They include a guided experience for each use case with sample reference synthetic datasets, AI model training pipelines, sample application code, and more. Deploy your AI models on IBM Z and benefit from the IBM Z Integrated Accelerator for AI.
