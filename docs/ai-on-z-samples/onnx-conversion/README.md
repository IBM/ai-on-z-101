# Exporting or converting a model to the ONNX format

This project contains some simple jupyter notebook examples demonstrating [ONNX](https://github.com/onnx/onnx) model conversion. This includes:
- Exporting a simple model from [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) to ONNX format.
- Converting a tensorflow model to ONNX, using [tensorflow-onnx](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx).

These examples will require you install needed packages. This is not done as part of the notebook. 

There are numerous additional examples and guidance available, not only for Pytorch and TensorFlow, but for other frameworks as well.

This includes:
- Building, exporting or converting a model [here](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html)
- tensorflow-onnx [examples](https://github.com/onnx/tensorflow-onnx/tree/master/examples)
- pytorch [guidance and examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html)


On IBM Z and LinuxONE, you can run these models using [ONNX-MLIR](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir).
For z/OS users, we recommend you try Watson Machine Learning for z/OS Trial edition, available [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/machine-learning-for-zos).
